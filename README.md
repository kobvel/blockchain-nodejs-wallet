## Blockchain wallet

### [Blockchain Node.js server](https://github.com/kobvel/blockchain-nodejs)

This repository is an addition to the [bockchain-nodejs](https://github.com/kobvel/blockchain-nodejs) application which shows how decentralized networks work.

Using this app you can easily perform such operations:
* Create multiple wallets
* Send coins between wallets
* Switch between blockchain nodes
*(if system is fully decentralized it must not make difference which node you use for the transactions)*

This client-side has also micro **node.js server** to be able to get addresses of known nodes which is going to by wallet.
